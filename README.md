# BRB-Demo
BRB experimental implementation

# Requirements
```
pandas==0.20.3
```
```
numpy==1.14.5
```
```
matplotlib==2.1.0
```
```
scipy==0.19.1
```

steps for implementation of BRB
1) Get input and output data
2) Generate rules
3) Transform data as a distribution over a set of referential values
4) set initial values of parameters of BRB
5) Inference process: find activated rules, activation weight, aggregate the beliefs (output of all rules) by evidential reasoning 
6) optimize BRB model
7) Test and validate
